# Introduction
Agriculture is the most important economic sector of many developing countries. Most of the activities are done with a lack of modern technology. Currently, seed classification is done based on knowledge of human being. The purification of seed material becomes a significant part in this development and needs to be improved. Specifying the nature of wheat manually requires a specialist judgment and is time consuming.
The project deals with finding the accuracy of Seeds data. For doing this, six machine learning algorithms are used, that is, Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),KNeighbors Classifier (KNN), Decision Tree Classifier (CART), Gaussian NB (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM).
# Python libraries 
This Project uses Python version 3.6. For implementing this project you need to install these libraries
Scipy,Numpy,Matplotlib,Sklearn,Pandas.

# Methodology
## Preprocessing of data
Data collection, data pre-processing (data cleaning, attribute selection, data formatting and transformation, dimensionality reduction and the like) are the most important activities under data preparation, which finally resulted in creating target data set.After data collection, data pre-processing procedures were conducted to train more efficiently and then coordinate systems of the all the data were transformed to the same coordinate system so that all the data fit the model.
## Summarizing the dataset
Data of seeds can be collected from various sources. In this project I have collected seeds data fromkaggle. Data is stored in Excel file in .csv file format. Here, pandas library is used for load the data. Pandas are also used to explore the data both with data visualization and descriptive statistics.

# Conclusions
In this study, our goal was to classify seed accuracy using machine algorithms. For this we used six different algorithms to implement. Eight independent variables were selected and examined in developing the model. The model is developed for prediction of determinant factors of seeds based on Machine Learning.
In this research we used Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K Neighbors Classifier (KNN), Decision Tree Classifier (CART), Gaussian NB (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We send information in normal and scaled manner, and then prediction was performed. Based on all the outcomes we concluded that Support Vector Machine (SVM) perform better than all algorithm. The accuracy of this algorithm emerged out to be more than that algorithm. The machine learning approach is recommended as flexible and precise way to solve the stated issue.
